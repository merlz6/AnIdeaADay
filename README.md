For this project I wanted to learn how to use React with Express and Node.
My previous two works have used react with non-JS backends(Ruby) and I wanted to use a true front to back experience in Javascript.
CSS was completed wit Bootstrap to save time and focus.

I followed the MERN model setup found from the below:

I also wanted to build this as I have been writing down random business, tech, innovention to ideas about everyday life for a few years now.
